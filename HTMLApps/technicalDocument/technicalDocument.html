        <p>JavaScript is a beginner-friendly programming language that allows developers to design interactive websites.
          On the other hand, Java is a complex language used to build sophisticated applications like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Android apps</li>
            <li>chatbots</li>
            <li>financial software</li>

          Java and JavaScript have distinct purposes, strengths, and limitations.
          These factors can influence the types of projects you can create and the careers you pursue.
          Some tech professionals learn both Java and JavaScript, but they may be optional, depending on your professional goals.
          This guide covers the key differences between Java and JavaScript to help you decide which programming language to learn.

          Before learning JavaScript, you must know how to code with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
          That’s because these two tools are fundamental to web development.HTML provides the basic framework for websites, and CSS adds styling elements,
          like font color, size, and layout. Without these tools, you wouldn’t have anything to apply your JavaScript skills towards.
          Fortunately, each of these tools is relatively straightforward to learn. Noble Desktop even offers an Intro to HTML and CSS course that teaches the
          foundations of these markup languages. This includes learning to code a webpage, format paragraphs, create links, add images, and style pages.
          Individuals who want to take their HTML and CSS skills a step beyond might also consider Noble’s Web Development with HTML and CSS or Advanced HTML and CSS courses.

          Many people think that moving from Java to JavaScript is like switching from driving a car to driving a lorry
          – they expect it to be fairly similar since both are vehicles. However, Java and JavaScript are as distinct from each other as a car and a sailboat.
          While both are a means of transportation, their skills, knowledge, and environment are entirely different.
        </p>

          JavaScript is an interpreted language, which means it must be executed – or activated – by a JavaScript engine.
          The developer writes JavaScript code and embeds it in a webpage. The code remains dormant until a user opens the webpage in a web browser
          like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. These web browsers contain JavaScript engines that execute the JavaScript code, activating interactive
          features such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>carousels</li>
            <li>drop-down menus</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          <code>
               let x, y, z;    // Statement 1
                x = 5;          // Statement 2
                y = 6;          // Statement 3
                z = x + y;      // Statement 4
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
          By contrast, Java is a compiled language requiring two steps to execute. First, a compiler translates the human-written source code into bytecode,
          the language of computers. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) interprets the bytecode into a usable format for a specific operating system and executes it.
          This process allows developers to write Java code for any platform.

        <p>Now, with ES6, there are three ways of defining your variables: var, let, and const.</p>
        <p>
          If you use var outside of a function, it belongs to the global scope.
          If you use var inside of a function, it belongs to that function.
          If you use var inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is still available outside of that block.

        <p>Babel is a JavaScript compiler that can translate markup or programming languages into JavaScript.
          With Babel, you can use the newest features of JavaScript (ES6 - ECMAScript 2015).
          Babel is available for different conversions. React uses Babel to convert JSX into JavaScript.
