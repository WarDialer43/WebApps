                History of the Linux Kernal and the open source initiatives that sprung up.

           <ul>
                <li>
                    1960's was the begining of the pregeneter to Linux called Unix a joint project between Bell labs and the Pentagon that also sprung Minix which is still used tothis day as the
                    closed source and restricted access os of all Intel CPU's that ended on the mid 2000's when the lats eteration of this dying popreity os called Sco Unix imploaded.

                <li>
                    August 25th 1984: Linus Tivalds made a post on the Minix user group announcing his his
                    work on a free operating system for 386(486) AT clones. He stated it was “just a hobby, won’t be big and professional lik

                <li>
                    September 17th, 1991: Linux version 0.01 was released, containing the initial code and basic functionality.
                    The first usable version of Linux, version 0.02, came out in October 1991, consisting of approximately 10,239 lines of code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The early development of the Linux kernel saw its distribution restricted by non-commercial licenses.
                    However, a crucial decision was made to the Linux kernel in 1992 with the release of version 0.12. It was relicensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL),
                    marking a significant shift in Linux evolution.This switch from a non-commercial license to the GPL made Linux open source, allowing anyone to freely use, modify,
                    and distribute the kernel. Linus Torvalds himself considers this decision to be the best he ever made.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fledgling Linux kernel found a perfect partner in the GNU Project: a group developing a free and open-source operating system. The GNU Project provided essential
                    components like utilities and Linux tools that, when combined with the Linux kernel, formed the foundation for a complete GNU/Linux operating system.
                    As Linux grew, the need for complete operating systems built around it also grew. This critical need led to the creation of Linux distributions, or “distros.”
                    1992 saw the release of MCC Interim Linux, one of the first distributions. Others soon followed:

                    Slackware (1993)
                    Debian (1993)
                    Red Hat Linux (1994)
                    SUSE Linux (1994)
                </li>
                <li>
                    1994: Linux 1.0.0 Arrived

                    On March 14th, Linux 1.0.0 was released, consisting of 176,250 lines of code and providing support for single-processor Intel 80386 (i386) systems.
                    Tux: Symbol of Linux In 1996, Linus Torvalds announced that Linux would have a penguin mascot, inspired by an incident where he was bitten by a little penguin
                    during a visit to the National Zoo and Aquarium in Canberra, Australia. Larry Ewing created the original draft based on this idea. The name Tux, suggested by James Hughes,
                    is a play on “Torvalds’ UniX” and “tuxedo,” reflecting the penguin’s appearance. Since its creation, Tux has remained the symbol of Linux for over two decades.

                    1996: Linux Kernel 2.0

                    The Linux kernel 2.0 was released, introducing support for multiple processors in a single system (SMP) and more extensive hardware compatibility.

                    1999: Windows Refund Day

                    On February 15, 1999, in a playful protest known as “Windows Refund Day,” Linux users around the world visited Microsoft offices, attempting to return the
                    unused Windows licenses that came bundled with their computers.

                    1998-2000: Entering Enterprise

                    The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed a paradigm shift in the Linux evolution: a surge of interest from the business world. Major tech companies began to recognize
                    the potential of Linux, leading to several key developments:

                    1999: IBM joined forces with Red Hat, announcing support for Linux
                    1999: Dell began pre-installing Linux on select servers
                    2000: The GNOME and KDE desktop environments evolved, making Linux more user friendly for desktop users.
                    2000: IBM invested $1 billion in Linux development.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2003: The SCO Group Lawsuit

                    The SCO Group (SCO) launched a legal assault in 2003, suing IBM for $1 billion. They claimed that Linux contained copyrighted Unix code.
                    This battle, which ultimately failed, underscored the importance of understanding the legal and historical context of Linux’s intellectual property.

                <li>
                    2004: Ubuntu 4.10 Released

                    On October 20, 2004, Canonical Ltd. released Ubuntu 4.10, codenamed “Warty Warthog,” a distribution that made Linux more accessible to non-geek users and significantly
                    boosted its adoption on desktops and laptops.

                <li>
                    2005: Linus Torvalds’ Git

                    The creation of Git by Linus Torvalds revolutionized version control, becoming an essential tool for software development and marking a significant milestone in the Linux
                    evolution.
